What makes Esri different than Microsoft/Facebook/Google?

A lot smaller than the giants, a lot bigger than other specialty mapping companies
We don't sell advertising (ie: users aren't our 'currency')
Our tools are dataset agnostic
Not publicly traded, don't need to answer to shareholders each quarter

Why should you care?

we (and more importantly our customers) are working on 'things that matter'
the intersection of a particular domain and technology is exciting!
the geospatial landscape evolves continuously
